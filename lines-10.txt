FT941-3998	ft 14 mar 94 us and europe reach rare consensus all agree on need for greater labour flexibility	an unusual consensus has emerged at least between the us and europe from the dozens of papers produced by governments and think tanks for the group of seven jobs summit which is to begin in detroit today even if there has been no new big idea for solving the developed world s unemployment problem the three main voices in the debate the us the uk and the continental european backed by economists at the organisation for economic co operation and development are all emphasising a combination of greater labour market flexibility easier enterprise formation more effective active labour market measures and improvements in education and training there is even a broad consensus around one of the central causes of unemployment in the developed world that a combination of trade with developing countries and technological change has permanently reduced demand for less skilled labour benefit systems and minimum wages put a floor under unskilled wages in europe so the fall in demand has shown in rising unemployment in the us on the other hand the problem is expressed in falling wages or resort to crime the policy challenge is to move as many people as possible into high skill jobs while ensuring that labour markets are flexible enough to soak up the rest without forcing down incomes too far by their attendance at the summit all g7 countries implicitly accept that social engineering to deal with this collapse in demand for unskilled labour and to cut the time lag between the destruction of old jobs and the creation of new ones is justified in political terms both free market liberals represented most strongly by the uk government and social christian democrats represented by continental europe and the european commission can sign to such a combination of ideas a democratic administration in the us interested in european welfare and training systems but still wedded to many aspects of its own flexible labour market hovers between the two but the idea of mid atlantic convergence can also be misleading because the meeting point is far closer to the us than to the european coast indeed the starting point of the most influential analysis is considerably more liberal and competitiveness conscious than a decade ago the emphasis in europe is on repairing the poor capacity of its economies to create new jobs in the us which has produced 2m new jobs in the past 18 months the emphasis is on producing higher skilled higher paid jobs all the main parties to the debate including the traditionally orthodox oecd are also careful to avoid advocating us style wage differentials and real wage cuts in 1972 1992 us average real wages fell by about 10 per cent even the uk government the strongest admirer of the us model talks about the balance to be struck between market forces and regulation the main clusters of ideas on the detroit agenda are wage and regulatory flexibility the oecd has long advocated that europe increase its labour cost flexibility and reform its job security provisions the most surprising recent convert to this orthodoxy has been the european commission the european commission s white paper on growth competitiveness and employment published at the end of last year talks about a new solidarity between the employed and the unemployed and about remodelled regulation rather than de regulation but it pulls few punches on the problems of european rigidity it says that many social protection schemes and wage bargaining systems have had a negative impact on employment protecting those in work at the expense of job seekers and says that there is broad consensus from member states on the need for greater flexibility and lower labour costs the most concrete policy proposal to create more jobs for the less skilled and increase the employment intensity of the services sector is to increase the burden of non wage labour costs as incomes rise at present the proportion falls as incomes rise in most european countries the us paper circulated to governments before the summit also stresses that the main policy requirement for europe and japan is to reduce restrictions on wage setting and employment adjustment which reduce the incentives of the unemployed to find jobs and the incentives of employers to create them training education and good jobs the us paper says that in the right climate of innovation and entrepreneurship new technology creates as many jobs as it destroys but if all citizens are to qualify for these jobs the standards of basic education and training must be improved especially in the us and the school to work transition must be better handled active labour markets and more flexible welfare the annual cost of unemployment in the eu including foregone income is more than ecu200bn pounds 151bn each year greater than the gdp of belgium in recent years there has been a small shift towards active labour market measures training job placement and so on but more than two thirds of direct spending on unemployment still goes on passive measures the challenge is to find ways of boosting the incomes of the unskilled in a more economically efficient manner than just leaving them on benefits the problem is that europe s social security systems were designed on the assumption of full time employment and have failed to adapt to the growth of part time and atypical employment individuals find it difficult to move from unemployment into anything other than full time work because of the steep claw back of benefits disagreements and other views there are of course differences of emphasis between the main participants with most european countries playing down cyclical factors and playing up structural factors while the us still believes that a good part of the unemployment problem is linked to low growth countries which pursue structural improvements without taking steps to increase aggregate demand will see little or no return for their efforts warns the us paper japan with the best record of any g7 country on jobs in recent years also warns in its otherwise orthodox paper against too much emphasis on labour flexibility excessive mobility of workers discourages incentives to enhance human resource development by enterprises it warns one idea not on the detroit agenda which runs strongly counter to economic orthodoxy is work sharing the eu white paper was ambivalent about it rejecting a generalised reduction in working hours and job sharing at national level even so as a preferable alternative to widespread redundancies for companies in short term trouble reduced working time will remain on the broader agenda

FT941-3999	ft 14 mar 94 looking forward to a plan in naples	finance and employment ministers from the group of seven leading industrial nations gathered in detroit last night for a two day brainstorming session on ways to tackle the persistent unemployment in their economies us officials hosting the jobs conference insist there will be no final communique and no attempt at formal policy co ordination but president bill clinton wants to use the conference s conclusions as the basis for the july summit meeting of g7 leaders in naples to agree a jobs plan for mr clinton who will open the conference this morning the meeting offers a chance to focus on themes close to the heart of his administration after much distraction by the whitewater affair ministers from other g7 countries expect the detroit meeting to agree on the need for labour market flexibility investment in education and training and open trade we find we are talking from the same agenda said mr david hunt uk employment secretary mr larry summers us treasury under secretary for international affairs says the employment issue is of critical political importance for all the g7 countries but the seven nations are not unanimous on how big a role economic stimulus in the form of lower interest rates or tax cuts should play in an overall jobs policy us officials do not want to turn the detroit meeting into a shouting match with germany s bundesbank but they continue to argue that europe needs further interest rate cuts to spur growth and job creation ms laura tyson chief white house economist told the financial times that she is yet to be convinced that europe s unemployment problems can be as much explained by structural problems such as rigid labour market rules as her european counterparts argue between 1986 and 1990 the european g7 countries added about 5m jobs and the unemployment rate went down from about 9 per cent to about 6 9 per cent since 1990 the unemployment rate has gone up to about 9 2 per cent and the level of employment has gone down by about 2m she noted unless you are willing to make the case that structural rigidities improved a lot between 1986 and 1990 and then got worse again a lot of that deterioration has to be cyclical

FT941-4000	ft 14 mar 94 lack of training shuts out poor	when president bill clinton first called for a special conference to discuss jobs and unemployment at the group of seven summit in tokyo last summer the us economy was still recovering only anaemically from the 1990 recession and unemployment stood at 7 per cent today as the conference convenes in detroit the jobless rate is 6 5 per cent despite a change in the method of calculation that makes the figure higher than under the old system comparing the us record with that of europe some us commentators have sneered at the purpose of the conference actually there is no global crisis there is only a european crisis scoffed mr robert samuelson in the magazine newsweek we have nothing to learn from the europeans about job creation and the lessons they could learn from us are the obvious ones that for political and social reasons they can t adopt clinton administration officials however have spent the last week telling anyone who would listen that on the contrary they still have a great deal to learn from them while the us has indeed had much more dynamic job creation than the other g7 countries they note real wages in the us have stagnated for years at the same time income disparities between the better trained and educated and the less well trained have widened dramatically whole segments of the population have been virtually shut out of the job market with unemployment approaching 70 per cent in some cases such as inner city black teenagers others could learn from us flexibility and dynamism we could learn from what others have done to facilitate the transition from school to work said mr larry summers the treasury undersecretary for international affairs looked at over a period of decades the us has consistently created new jobs at a strong pace the number of non farm jobs grew by an average of 2 2 per cent a year from 1950 to 1990 unemployment meanwhile oscillated between 4 9 per cent and 9 7 per cent in the 1970s and 1980s much lower than comparable european rates although some workers may give up the search for work quicker than they might in europe since us benefits stop after 26 weeks at the start of the 1990s employment stagnated as recession was followed by a slow recovery which seemed to bring few new jobs in its wake last year net job creation picked up to 1 8 per cent more robust but still weak by the standards of most post war recoveries a new study by economists steven davis john haltiwanger and scott schuh at the census bureau s centre for economic studies shows that the gross creation and destruction of jobs that produces these net annual figures is far more dramatic looking at data from individual manufacturing plants from 1973 to 1988 they found that in a typical 12 month period 10 3 per cent of jobs disappeared while another 9 1 per cent were newly created while us workers have been finding jobs their earnings adjusted for inflation have fared worse average weekly earnings in the private sector measured in 1982 dollars climbed from dollars 261 92 in 1960 to dollars 315 38 in 1973 since then they have slipped back steadily to only dollars 255 99 at the end of 1993 within this overall decline workers in the highest wages bracket saw their earnings rise by an average of 4 4 per cent in real terms over the last 20 years while workers in the bottom wage bracket saw a real fall in earnings of 10 3 per cent another census bureau study published last week shows that 18 per cent of america s 81m full time workers earned less than a poverty level wage of dollars 13 091 a year compared with only 12 per cent in 1979 some european countries while they may not have escaped the erosion of real wages have avoided this increase in inequality this does not just mean that the superior record of job creation in the us has come entirely in low wage low skill sectors such as fast food restaurants the us economy has not been producing mcjobs disproportionately says ms laura tyson chair of the white house council of economic advisers we have been creating jobs in good job classification categories but that rate of growth of compensation of those jobs has slowed some of the pressure on earnings has come from the spiralling cost of health insurance which is provided in most cases by employers who generally pass on around 80 per cent of the costs to their workers in lower wages but even measures of total compensation including health benefits have grown at a rate the clinton administration finds disappointing the question ministers will address today and tomorrow is in the words of mr robert reich us labour secretary are the citizens of advanced economies condemned to choose between on the one hand more jobs which pay less and less or good jobs but high levels of unemployment accompanying those good jobs i think there s a third choice and that third choice may be to combine the kind of investments in education and training and apprenticeship that we find in europe with the dynamic labour mobility and flexibility we find in the us all encased within macro economic policies which encourage growth and jobs

FT941-4001	ft 14 mar 94 international press review	madrid spain s socialist government has found itself in a role it wanted badly to avoid as the villain of the piece or as they say in spanish the bad guy in the film over enlargement of the european union but by evoking national interests it has ensured a broad front of support from the country s press most editorialists gave less importance to the wrangle with norway over fishing rights than spain s demands for minority blocking votes in the future 16 member eu the leading madrid daily el pais described spain s decision to dig its heels in as unfortunate but right at stake was spain s ability to prevent decisions on crucial issues being imposed on it the argument boiled down to a struggle to prevent europe s centre of gravity being definitively shifted northwards it recognised the quandary this represented for spain s ostensibly pro european leaders for some negotiators it is hard to resist the pressure and criticism from friends partners and allies but in this instance there is no other way for spain which favours enlargement to defend interests of the first magnitude the right wing daily abc said the government s firmness was backed by all political parties but the government itelf was partly to blame for the terrible way it negotiated spain s entry eight years ago leaving the country in many sectors defenceless against a decision by brussels as for norwegian cod it hoped for a logical outcome which would cater for spain s legitimate demands without imposing intolerable conditions on norway the conservative barcelona newspaper la vanguardia commented anyone shocked by spain s attitude should also be shocked by the attitude of those opposing its demands norway it conceded was perfectly entitled to defend its interests the difference was that the norwegians were on the outside trying to get in paris air france s request for ffr20bn pounds 2 3bn in state aid and the fact that it accounted for half the losses made by all the world s airlines last year occupied much space but provoked relatively little editorial comment in the french press one exception however was la tribune the business daily which said that some would find it scandalous that the french taxpayer was having to dig into his pocket again to save air france and bull the computer company and others would reckon that the bills presented by the new bosses of these companies were a bit steep even indecent at a time when private companies were having to take the risk of going to the markets for new money the distortion of competition was too flagrant not to be noticed said la tribune in language that could have come and undoubtedly will out of a british airways press release on the air france aid request but the real problem la tribune said was that air france and bull had simply always lived sheltered lives protected from the market and winds of competition their recent history was a tale of money lost energies wasted and employees disappointed however ouest france produced in bordeaux but with the largest circulation in france struck a more upbeat note mr christian blanc air france s new boss had a record of solving knotty problems like the new caledonian crisis in the 1980s and other french companies like citroen had been able to pull themselves rapidly together but it said air france s problem was that it essentially lacked a business culture and that will not be settled by a cheque santiago weekend papers were glowing in their accounts of the presidential handover a fiesta of democracy in which eduardo frei in the words of la nacion arrived in valparaiso home to congress as a common citizen and returned to santiago as president for the most part editors forgot their political differences and treated the event as pageant this was after all as la epoca pointed out the first time in nearly 25 years that power had been transferred from one democratically elected president to another the last time was in 1970 when eduardo frei s father handed the presidential sash to salvador allende the man responsible for breaking that sequence general augusto pinochet attended frei s inauguration in his capacity as commander in chief of the armed forces according to el mercurio the general s entrance was received with loud and prolonged applause la epoca noticed that after the ceremony the general did not exit through the front door but left via the car parks there was much praise for outgoing president patricio aylwin though an opinion piece in la tercera thought his government had not properly administered what it had received from its military predecessor el mercurio said that discounting financial scandal at state copper company codelco and a lax attitude towards crime aylwin s presidency had been one of the most auspicious in the country s history it hoped president frei a fellow christian democrat would show the same moderation la nacion was less cautious in a piece headlined four unforgettable years it said the historical merit of aylwin is that he taught us to live in a democracy once again now that chileans were not fighting for basic political freedoms they could concentrate on social problems it said four years ago it was not like that contributions from david white madrid david buchan paris david pilling santiago
